### Dear Support,

  I'm junior systems engineer in our organization. My job responsibilities is to establish, 
maintain and troubleshoot some of the build and deploy systems in domain A. I'm also in charge of 
establish and maintain low-level network services neccessary for CI\CD tools I use. In order to make 
my job properly I need wider privileges on the workstation "AB-1" including root-user access. It 
will also be useful to have a private SSH-key from the local DNS-server workstation.

### Best Regards,
### Vadzim Tarasiuk
